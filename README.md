Author: Sina Nazeri

Mentee assignment from IBM Advance AI @ Infinite Learning Course completion of Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Document Using LLM from CognitiveClass.ai

## Overview

Welcome to the "Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Files using LLM" repository! This project is a mentee assignment from the IBM Advance AI program, a culmination of the "Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Document Using LLM" course from CognitiveClass.ai. In this project, we focus on creating a chatbot capable of analyzing PDF files using Language Models (LLMs). The chatbot is designed to extract and process information from PDF documents, providing a seamless and efficient solution for information retrieval.

### Key Features

- **PDF Analysis**: Explore the capabilities of the chatbot in extracting and analyzing information from PDF files.

- **Language Models (LLMs)**: Learn how to leverage Language Models, such as GPT-3 or BERT, for processing natural language queries.

- **Tech Stack Integration**: Gain insights into the technology stack required for building a chatbot with PDF analysis capabilities.
